<div>Hi Eva,</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I&#39;m thrilled that you&#39;re on board with our vacation plans. It&#39;s going to be absolutely magical! I mean, that Bora Bora place looks magical!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Your sweet words and lovely thoughts about our future together always warm my heart. I can&#39;t wait for the day we can make those dreams come true.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>About the token of appreciation, I wanted to clarify that it&#39;s a gesture of gratitude not just for your hard work on the project but also as a little something extra because you hold a special place in my heart. ðŸ˜˜</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Can&#39;t wait for our getaway and to create wonderful memories together.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Take care,<br />
Rodrigo Caba&ccedil;o</div>

<div style="font-family: Arial , sans-serif;font-size: 14.0px;"><span>Hey Rodrigo,</span>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span>I hope you&#39;re doing well. I&#39;ve been thinking about our future together, especially with the tunnel project moving forward. Can you believe the potential here?</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span>I&#39;ve got this dream of us on vacation once it&#39;s all done. How about that beach escape we often talk about? Sun, sand, and cocktails &ndash; the works!</span></div>

<div><span>Take a look at &quot;Bora Bora, French Polynesia&quot; - I bet you will love it!</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span>I also wanted to say how incredibly grateful I am for your help with the QUCs. I&#39;m so close to get that reward on best teacher of DEI!! Your support means the world to me, and I can&#39;t help but feel a warm, tingly sensation every time I think about you. ðŸ˜˜</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span>And speaking of gratitude, I noticed the token you sent over, and it was such a lovely surprise. It means a lot to me. It&#39;s not just about the monetary value, but the sentiment behind it. You really do know how to keep a woman interested, and I must admit, it&#39;s quite intriguing. ðŸ˜˜</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span>Can&#39;t wait for our getaway and to chat more about everything soon!</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span>Take care,</span></div>
<span>Eva ðŸŒž</span></div>
