Sporting Clube de Portugal is a Portuguese sports club with a rich and diverse history. It was founded on July 1, 1906, with its headquarters in Lisbon at the Alvalade XXI Complex. It is one of the "Three Big Ones" clubs in Portugal, along with SL Benfica and FC Porto. The club boasts more than 175,000 registered members and over 2.6 million fans both nationally and worldwide. Its fans are known as "sportinguistas." Sporting has been national champion 19 times (or 23, according to the club) and won the Cup Winners' Cup once. Over the course of more than a century, Sporting teams and athletes have won nine Olympic medals (two gold, six silver, and one bronze). They have secured 42 European cups in seven different sports, along with numerous national and district titles. The Sporting Museum displays over two thousand trophies from thirty-two different sports, reflecting the club's rich history from 1902 to the present day.
While competing in various sports, Sporting is primarily known for its main football team, which has been national champion of the Portuguese League 19 times (or 23, according to the club). They have also won 17 Portuguese Cups, 4 Portuguese Championships, 9 Super Cups, 4 League Cups, and 1 Empire Cup (a total of 53 national trophies), in addition to 19 Lisbon Championships. Internationally, Sporting won the Cup Winners' Cup in 1963–64, a unique achievement in Portuguese sports, was the runner-up in the UEFA Cup in 2004–05, and won the Iberian Cup in 2000 and the Intertoto Cup in 1968. The club currently occupies the 29th position in the UEFA club ranking. Their most notable campaign in the European Cup was reaching the quarter-finals in the 1982–83 season.
Sporting Clube de Portugal has its origins in the founding of Belas Football Clube in 1902, initiated by two brothers, Francisco and José Horta Gavazzo. Two years later, due to internal disagreements within Belas Football Clube, some of its founding members created Campo Grande Football Clube, with José Alvalade as treasurer and Francisco Horta Gavazzo as secretary. Despite the name, this association was involved in various sports such as football, tennis, races, and jumps, as well as organizing parties, dances, and picnics, which led to conflicts with some members who believed that sports should be its primary focus. On April 13, 1906, during a General Assembly, divergent opinions about the institution's purpose led to the departure of five members. One of them, José Alvalade, immediately expressed the intention to form a new club with financial support from his grandfather, Dr. Alfredo Augusto das Neves Holtreman, 1st Viscount of Alvalade, who oversaw the creation of the new club and provided the land for the playing field on his estate. During the founding period, José Alvalade aimed to transform Sporting into "a great club, as great as the greatest in Europe." Guided by the aspiration to pave the way for sports in Portugal, at a time when it was still in its embryonic stage of development and had very elitist characteristics, the early "sportinguistas" founded Sporting Clube de Portugal, pursuing the ideals of "effort, dedication, devotion, and glory".The iconic green and white striped jerseys helped the club win thirteen National Football Championships and five Portuguese Cups from the late 1930s to the 1950s. President Joaquim Oliveira Duarte's vision played a significant role, as he hired football coach Joseph Szabo on February 27, 1937, leading the club to several glorious seasons. In the 1940/41 season, Sporting Clube de Portugal became the first Portuguese team to achieve a domestic double, winning both the national championship and the Portuguese Cup in the same season. They also won the Lisbon Championship, thus claiming all the titles in Portuguese football for that season. António Ribeiro Ferreira, serving as President from 1946 to 1953, had a tenure marked by significant achievements, including three consecutive national championships from 1947 to 1949. From 1950/51 to 1953/54, they secured four consecutive national championships under the guidance of Randolph Galloway. In 1955, José Travassos, a true strategic genius, became the first Portuguese football player to wear the European Selection jersey against Great Britain in Belfast, earning him the nickname "Zé da Europa.On July 10, 1956, the José Alvalade Stadium was inaugurated, and in the 1957/58 football season, Sporting became the first Portuguese team to advance past the first round of the European Cup Winners' Cup, now known as the UEFA Europa League. They won the first leg against VV DOS Utrecht (now Football Club Utrecht) in the Netherlands 3–4 and the second leg in Alvalade 2–1.
Sporting also had the legendary "Cinco Violinos" (Five Violins) – not musicians but players who displayed exceptional harmony on the Portuguese football fields. Between 1946 and 1949, footballers Jesus Correia, Vasques, Peyroteo, Travassos, and Albano became known for their goal-scoring prowess and titles. In the 1946–47 season, the team armed with the Cinco Violinos scored 123 goals in 26 games, winning 23 of them and averaging nearly five goals per match. Their coordination, orchestrated by coach Cândido de Oliveira, led Sporting to become tricampeão (three-time champion) in 1948–49.
In 1960, the club was declared an "Institution of Public Utility" by the Portuguese state. In the same year, the football team won the Cup Winners' Cup, defeating the Hungarian club MTK Budapest. They initially drew 3–3 but won the decisive match with a solitary goal scored directly from a corner kick, the famous and enduring "cantinho do Morais," winning the match 1–0. On their way to the final, Sporting defeated Manchester United 5–0, following a 4–1 loss in the first leg, and achieved a record that still stands today, with a 16–1 victory over Apoel Nicosia from Cyprus, the most significant win in a European competition. Player Hector Yazalde, also known as "Chirola," was transferred to Sporting from the Argentine club Independiente in 1970 and still holds the record for the most goals scored in a season in the Portuguese Primeira Liga, with 46 goals in 30 matches. Yazalde also set a new European record for goals on May 19, 1974, naturally becoming the European Golden Shoe winner, the first Argentine to achieve this feat, surpassing the record set by the Hungarian Skoblar. The Portuguese record has not been surpassed to this day, and it is the fourth-best European record of all time. As a reward, he received a Toyota car, which he sold, sharing the proceeds with his teammates.
In roller hockey, Sporting was a prominent team from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, winning the European Champions Cup (1977), two Cup Winners' Cups (1981, 1985), a CERS Cup (1984), three Portuguese Cups (1977, 1978, 1984), and an António Livramento Super Cup (1983). They became four-time national champions in 1978 and won the championship again in 1982. In cycling, the greatest Portuguese cyclist of all time, Joaquim Agostinho, achieved excellent results, winning the Volta a Portugal in Bicicleta (Tour of Portugal) three times in a row and finishing third on the podium in the Tour de France three times. Athlete Marco Chagas also secured several titles for the club, and cyclist Paulo Ferreira accomplished a unique feat in the world, boasting a stage victory in the Tour de France on his résumé. Sporting's table tennis team holds an impressive record of 11 consecutive national championships from 1984/85 to 1994/95, with a total of 30 championships, 20 Portuguese Cups, and 5 Super Cups, among many other trophies won by its individual and doubles players. Carlos Lopes, from Sporting Clube de Portugal, became the first Portuguese athlete to win a gold medal, an achievement awarded at the Los Angeles Olympics marathon. He had previously won a silver medal in the 10,000-meter run at the Montreal Olympics. On June 2, 1981, the club was honored as a Honorary Member of the Order of Infante D. Henrique, and in 1986, it received the Medal of Honor for Sporting Merit. Losing ground to rivals, the club's members elected Jorge Gonçalves, popularly known as "Bigodes," in 1988, hoping to initiate a period of change. However, his term was short, tumultuous, and marked by a severe financial crisis, leading to new elections the following year. At that time, the resigning president was decisively defeated by José de Sousa Cintra, who adopted an unconventional and populist style. During this new period, young star Luís Figo gained prominence, and Sporting managed to retain him until 1995, when he transferred to Futbol Club Barcelona. Cintra also succeeded in keeping other athletes at the club, preventing an exodus. Despite the main football team never managing to clinch the league title, the club achieved its third Cup Winners' Cup in roller hockey, became tricampeão (Three-time-champion) in volleyball, and won the European Cross Country Champions Cup six times in a row, with a notable performance by the Castro Twins. In roller hockey, Sporting won the Cup Winners' Cup in 1991. It was also Sousa Cintra who inaugurated the Sporting Museum at the José Alvalade Stadium. He left the position on June 2, 1995. The innovative Sporting Academy in Alcochete was inaugurated, becoming the first of its kind in Portugal. It was used during the 2004 European Football Championship as a training and preparation center for the Portuguese National Football Team. The Sporting Academy is the first and only in Europe to receive the quality certificate (ISO) awarded by the International Certification Company. The Academy is the result of an effort to invest in youth development. Sporting boasts the best European talent school and one of the best in the world, having provided more players to the National Team in FIFA World Cup finals than any other club (24 in total, compared to Benfica's 21 and Porto's 18). New talents emerge every year, with established names such as Luís Figo, Cristiano Ronaldo, Nani, and Rui Patrício. Sporting has already produced five FIFA Ballon d'Or winners: in 2000, 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2016.
The main football team became national champion in 2000, repeating the feat in 2002, and also winning the Portuguese Cup and Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira in the same year. Simultaneously, the main handball team became national champion in 2001 for the first time in 15 years. The new José Alvalade Stadium was inaugurated on August 6, 2003, in a celebration sponsored by Manchester United, a game that ended 3–1 in Sporting C.P.'s favor. The stadium has a seating capacity of 50,095, all covered, and hosted Euro 2004 and the UEFA Cup final in which Sporting Clube de Portugal was a finalist in the 2004/05 season. On July 1, 2005, the centennial celebrations began, lasting for a year with a multitude of activities on the agenda. Between 2005 and 2009, Paulo Bento assumed the role of club coach, making history as the second-longest-serving coach in Sporting's history, behind only Joseph Szabo. He won two Portuguese Cups and two Supertaças, and reached two Taça da Liga finals, but never managed to secure the league title, with Sporting finishing as runners-up four times in a row. The victory in the 2008 Supertaça would be the last football title for Sporting in that decade, ending in 2015.
On October 13, 2009, a total of 1,066 present members voted in favor of transferring the rights to Sporting – Comércio e Serviços, S.A., the company holding the football television rights, to Sporting – Sociedade Desportiva de Futebol, S.A.D. With the troubled term of Luís Godinho Lopes, the Roquette Project came to an end in 2013, having long been contested. Bruno de Carvalho was then elected as the new President of Sporting Clube de Portugal, becoming a nationally renowned figure with 53.69% of the club members' votes. In 2015, the former President was expelled from the club as a result of "very serious disciplinary infractions detrimental to the club's image and heritage". In October 2019, the current leadership of Sporting Clube de Portugal, under the presidency of Frederico Varandas, terminated the protocols it had signed on July 31 with the Juventude Leonina Association and the Directivo Ultras XXI due to an escalation of violence that culminated in attempted physical assaults on officials and other fans during a futsal victory over Leões de Porto Salvo (6–1) at the João Rocha Pavilion. International achievements continued in handball, where Sporting's professional team won its second Challenge Cup (25th European title), in athletics, where the club possesses an exceptional track record, including 215 national titles and 89 international titles and medals, and in judo, with the Champions League win (30th European title). With three European Club Champions Cup wins in 2018, the club continued to establish itself as Portugal's top powerhouse and one of the best in Europe and the world in athletics. In May 2019, the club reported having won 35 European titles in seven sports. In summary, respect the greatest in Portugal.
