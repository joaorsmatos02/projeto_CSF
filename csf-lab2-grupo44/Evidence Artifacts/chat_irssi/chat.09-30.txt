11:46 < ironcaesar> hey
11:46 < SpookyBerry> hi there! how is it going?
11:46 < ironcaesar> good, i was searching for active chats around
11:46 < ironcaesar> hard to find activity
11:47 < ironcaesar> what about u?
11:47 < SpookyBerry> I can imagine! I actually just got the idea to try and explore some IRC servers… Was messing with an old laptop of mine and there was an app installed for doing just that
11:48 < SpookyBerry> Figured it could be fun to try out, but it is hard to find places to talk!
11:48 < SpookyBerry> Other than that, not much here! Was actually about to head to bed
11:48 < ironcaesar> you must be on the oposite side of the earth then haha
11:48 < ironcaesar> i just woke up
11:51 < ironcaesar> if i were to guess i would say you are in the New zeeland timezone
11:52 < SpookyBerry> I wish haha… I actually just have a really messed up sleep schedule xD
11:52 < ironcaesar> oh so its not night yet there
11:53 < SpookyBerry> nope! it's about 8 in the morning lol
